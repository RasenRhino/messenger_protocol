- `Pickle RCE`: Exploit against the implementation of (Arjun Uppal and Parth Sonavane)
- `Flawed SRP`: Exploit against the implementation of (Maxwell Hwee & Ansh Juvvadi)
- `Authentication Bypass`: Exploit against the implementation of (Russell Van Duyne & Elaine Zhu). There was no script used for this in the demo as the interaction was shown manually and the flaw completely lies in the server side authentication logic. I have included a script now which achieves the same purpose by hardcoding the value of auth_token in the login request.
