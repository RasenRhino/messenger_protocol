- MITM: Script which forwards traffic between client and server. If there is a session key exfiltrated it tries to decrypt further messages. Just for the Proof of Concept Alice's session key is hardcoded and the proxy can only decrypt her traffic.
- Malicious Clients: Modified the client to send pickle payloads for reverse shell and extracting session keys respectively.
- Proxied Client: Pointed the client to the mitm proxy script to simulate mitm scenario.

Run the MITM script -> Login from the Proxied Client -> Run the Malicious scripts -> Decrypt traffic.
